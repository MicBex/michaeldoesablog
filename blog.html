    <p>Here are all of my blog posts.
    	<br><br>

    	<h2>November 2025</h2>
    	<a href="/posts/post13.html"><h3>It’s okay to do things just for fun</h3>
    	<img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/q2B4LtxDqvoAAAAC/konata-lucky-star.gif" alt="Konata Izumi from the anime Lucky Star playing video games" style="width:40%"></a>
    	<br>
    	<p>I do things just because they’re fun. Not because they have inherit value or because they get me somewhere. I just do them because they’re fun. That’s it. This might sound simple but I can ensure you that when I first set out to do this, it wasn’t easy at all.</p>

    	<a href="/posts/post12.html"><h3>Japan changed a lot in 8 years</h3>
    	<img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/srs1hXgXVQ8AAAAC/hi.gif" loading="lazy" alt="Anime airplane" style="width:40%"></a>
    	<br>
    	I've been back from my Japan trip for about <span title="12th of November 2025" style="text-decoration: underline;">2 days</span> now and don’t get me wrong, I had a good time. I met wonderful people and even got invited to go on a helicopter ride by a complete stranger, but nontheless, I can now say with confidence that I’m done with Japan.</a>
    	<br><br>

    	<h2>October 2025</h2>
    	<a href="/posts/post11.html"><h3>I needed ChatGPT for this Movie</h3>
    	<img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/MIeut0Z9NLAAAAAC/perfect-blue.gif" loading="lazy" alt="Mima from the movie Perfect Blue on the train" style="width:40%"></a>
    	<br>
    	<p><span title="15th of October 2025" style="text-decoration: underline;">Today</span> I watched an anime movie called <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/437/Perfect-Blue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perfect Blue</a> and let me tell you: it was <strong>confusing!</strong></p>
    	<a href="/posts/post10.html"><h3>I bet on Politics and LOST Everything</h3>
    	<img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/GuevIZnyKpkAAAAC/gyakkyou-burai-kaiji-kaiji-itou.gif" loading="lazy" atl="Kaiji from the anime 'Kaiji Ultimate Survivor' gambling with dice" style="width:40%"></a>
    	<br>
    	<p>I like gambling. I barely every do it, but when I do, I love it. A week ago I discovered a new form of gambling though: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymarket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PolyMarket</a>. PolyMarket, through the magic of crypto currency, allows one to gamble on anything and everything.</p>

    	<h2>September 2025</h2>
    	<a href="/posts/post9.html"><h3>I'm Feelig a bit Better</h3>
    	<img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/Qc2kUr8hXC4AAAAC/sigh-new-game.gif" loading="lazy" alt="Yun from the anime 'NEW GAME!' sighing in relief" style="width: 40%;"></a>
    	<br>
    	<p>These last eight months were truly awful. I experienced little to no joy in my life for a long time—but now, a spark is starting to come back. It’s still small and needs to be nurtured. I still need to take it easy every day. But instead of being constantly exhausted, I’m finally starting to get a bit of energy back.</p>

    	<h2>August 2025</h2>
    	<a href="/posts/post8.html"><h3>I Quit Coding</h3>
    	<img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/SxJQcg2-UGkAAAAC/working-from.gif" loading="lazy" alt="Anime guy using an old computer" style="width: 40%;"></a>
    	<br>
    	<p>Last year, I made a video about how I wanted to learn to code. I said that if I learned how to become a full-stack web developer, I could get a fully remote job and travel the world. Unfortunately, after giving it my all for a full year, I’ve decided to quit learning how to code.</p>
    	<br>

    	<h2>July 2025</h2>
	<a href="/posts/post7.html"><h3>It's NOT that damn Phone</h3>
	<img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/QTtX8fpH_DEAAAAC/akane-shinjo-anime.gif" loading="lazy" alt="Anime girl using her smartphone" style="width: 40%;"></a>
	<br>
	<p>I doubt that people are actually addicted to their smartphones. I do believe many are addicted to social media. But why aren't we blaming PC's and laptops too then? Smartphones are very useful tools, not addiction machines.</p>
    	<a href="/posts/post6.html"><h3>You Need a Hobby</h3>
    	<img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/XX58j8Qof7oAAAAC/shion-shion-yozakura.gif" loading="lazy" alt="Anime girl doom scrolling" style="width: 40%;"></a>
    	<br>
    	You need a hobby. We all do. I realized how important hobbies were when I noticed how many people believe they need a job to feel fulfilled.
    	<a href="/posts/post5.html"><h3>Please Save Your Money</h3>
    	<img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/tCgEoq43LiMAAAAC/anime.gif" loading="lazy" alt="Reigen from the anime 'Mob Psycho 100' walking while the sun is setting behind him" style="width: 40%;"></a>
    	<br>
    	You don’t need to invest your money. You don’t need to buy low and sell high, or invest into a meme coin and pray to the gods that it’ll 100x over a timespan of 5 days. In my opinion, there is only 1 single thing that you should do: set a savings goal and achieve it over a timespan you’re comfortable with.
    	<br><br>
    	<a href="/posts/post4.html"><h3>Walking Saves Lives</h3>
    	<img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/LVoQCbqMcSUAAAAC/mob-psycho100-walking.gif" loading="lazy" alt="Reigen from the anime 'Mob Psycho 100' walking while the sun is setting behind him" style="width: 40%;"></a>
    	<br>
    	Walking saves lives. Now I understand that’s a bold statement, but I stand by it. Walking is a mental super power that is able to turn your life around. It did for me, it has done for those in the past and it’s still doing so for many of us right now.

    	<h2>June 2025</h2>
    	<a href="/posts/post3.html"><h3>I Quit My Well-Paying Job</h3>
    <img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/49l1aro_8LAAAAAC/gto-great-teacher-onizuka.gif" loading="lazy" alt="Onizuka from the anime 'Great Teacher Onizuka'" style="width: 40%;"></a>
    <br>
    So recently I had the chance to go back to my teaching job, with even more benefits and job security. Basically, my future was secure. Yet I turned it down. Let me explain...
    <br><br>
    	<a href="/posts/post2.html"><h3>Summer 2025 Anime Recommendations</h3>
    <img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/SRMzSOI1QIUAAAAC/vamp.gif" loading="lazy" alt="Nazuna Nanakusa from the anime 'Call of the Night' giving us a double peace sign" style="width: 40%;"></a>
    <br>
    Summer 2025 is here which also means another batch of new anime is upon us. In this post I'll be talking about both completely new anime as well as new seasons of already running shows. I won't be going over every new release either, only the ones I'll be giving a try myself.
    	<br><br>
    	<a href="/posts/post1.html"><h3>First Time using MacOS</h3>
    <img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/iMUKJ0TEeOkAAAAC/anime-keyboard.gif" loading="lazy" alt="Konata Izumi from the anime 'Lucky Star' typing on a keyboard" style="width: 40%;"></a>
    <br>
    I found €85 worth of giftcards in one of my drawers and decided to buy a Mac Mini M4. I'm an avid linux user but am quite surprised by how nice it is to use MacOS. It did take a bit of tinkering to get it to my liking though.
