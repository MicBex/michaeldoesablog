    <p>Here are all of my blog posts.

    	<h2>July 2025</h2>
    	<a href="/posts/post5.html"><h2>Please Save Your Money</h2>
    	<img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/tCgEoq43LiMAAAAC/anime.gif" loading="lazy" alt="Reigen from the anime 'Mob Psycho 100' walking while the sun is setting behind him" style="width: 40%;"></a>

    	You don’t need to invest your money. You don’t need to buy low and sell high, or invest into a meme coin and pray to the gods that it’ll 100x over a timespan of 5 days. In my opinion, there is only 1 single thing that you should do: set a savings goal and achieve it over a timespan you’re comfortable with.

    	<a href="/posts/post4.html"><h2>Walking Saves Lives</h2>

    	Walking saves lives. Now I understand that’s a bold statement, but I stand by it. Walking is a mental super power that is able to turn your life around. It did for me, it has done for those in the past and it’s still doing so for many of us right now.

    	<h2>June 2025</h2>
    	<a href="/posts/post3.html"><h2>I Quit My Well-Paying Job</h2>
    <img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/49l1aro_8LAAAAAC/gto-great-teacher-onizuka.gif" loading="lazy" alt="Onizuka from the anime 'Great Teacher Onizuka'" style="width: 40%;"></a>
    <br>
    So recently I had the chance to go back to my teaching job, with even more benefits and job security. Basically, my future was secure. Yet I turned it down. Let me explain...

    	<a href="/posts/post2.html"><h2>Summer 2025 Anime Recommendations</h2>
    <img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/SRMzSOI1QIUAAAAC/vamp.gif" loading="lazy" alt="Nazuna Nanakusa from the anime 'Call of the Night' giving us a double peace sign" style="width: 40%;"></a>

    Summer 2025 is here which also means another batch of new anime is upon us. In this post I'll be talking about both completely new anime as well as new seasons of already running shows. I won't be going over every new release either, only the ones I'll be giving a try myself.

    	<a href="/posts/post1.html"><h2>First Time using MacOS</h2>

    I found €85 worth of giftcards in one of my drawers and decided to buy a Mac Mini M4. I'm an avid linux user but am quite surprised by how nice it is to use MacOS. It did take a bit of tinkering to get it to my liking though.
