	<h2>2025 Sucked for me</h2>
	<p>
    2025 is coming to an end and what a horrible year it has been for me. For about 9 months all I did was sleep and feel bad about myself and my situation. Burn out sucks and I’m glad my energy and joy in life is coming back. Although 2025 sucked for me I am going to try to make 2026 a better year for myself.

    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    <p>
    My first set of resolutions are what I consider ‘the basics’. These are non-negotiable and have to be achieved, mainly because they’re completely in my hands.
    <br><br>
    My first resolution is to lose 25 KG. I have already lost 5 KG so I have 20 KG more to go. My health should be, and should have been, my main priority. I started out with a weight of 94.5 KG, which meant I had a BMI that was far into the ‘Obese’ category. After I have reached my goal of 70 KG I should have a healthy BMI again.
    <br><br>
    My second resolution is to learn more about Stoicism and to actively practice its philosophy. I am not a God-fearing man and don’t see myself ever changing my atheist views, but I can’t deny that religion fills a hole that atheists like me struggle with: purpose and how to deal with living.
    <br><br>
    Stoicism might not give me more purpose in life, which is something I’ll need to find myself, but I do believe it is able to give me the right tools to deal with hardships.
    <br><br>

    <h2>The Extras</h2>
    My second set of resolutions are goals I will strive towards, but due to them being also influenced by external forces I can’t guarantee	their success.
    <br><br>
    My third resolution would be to find employment again. I will first need to be fully healed from my burn out and then also find a no-stress job that suits this current phase of my life, but it’s a good goal to strive towards nonetheless.
    <br><br>
    My fourth resolution is to move out of my parents’ house and live on my own. There are currently new apartments being built rather close to my house and I am hoping to rent one once they’re finished. They should be done in 2026 so fingers crossed.
    <br><br>

    <h2>The Maybes</h2>
    My third and final set of resolutions are the maybes. The ones I am interested in but don’t have any priority over the other ones. I might dabble in these or will postpone them to 2027.
    <br><br>
    My fifth resolution is to get a personal trainer. I’d first want to lose the 25 KG but after that I’d like to get physically fit and mucking about on my own seems very ineffective. I have no idea how to get fit and strong hence the need for a personal trainer. Losing all that weight is way more important for my health than getting jacked, so that’s why this is a maybe. It’d be cool, but it’s not a necessity.
    <br><br>
    My sixth and final resolution would be to start dating again. I haven’t been on a date since my university days in Osaka, Japan. Due to me being exhausted all the time I didn’t feel like dating for years, but I think I’m ready to meet women again either in 2026 or 2027. This is a low-priority resolution because I can feel that I’m not ready for dating yet due to my burn out. The other things on my list are just way more important. But in the future I’d like to give dating another try.
    <br><br>
    I’m very curious to see which goals I will and won’t achieve in 2026. Cheers to another year!
