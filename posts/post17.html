	<h2>16th of February 2026</h2>
	<p>
	Starting from the 16th of February 2026 I will be required to start applying for jobs again if I want to continue receiving the small allowance my previous employer is currently paying me.
	I could naturally refuse, but frankly I am feeling well enough to start thinking about going back to work again.
	<br><br>
	Don't get me wrong, there is no way in <strong>hell</strong> I'm going back to teaching, but I do feel like I'm ready for another job.
	It does suck that most of the jobs I'm able to apply for are paying <strong>a lot</strong> less then my teaching job, but hey, you can't win 'em all!

    <h2>What about an education?</h2>
    <p>
	My mother is advising me to go back to studying so I'm able to get a decent job with decent pay. Now to be fair that is good advice, but I don't think I have it in me to go through that again.
	I think I'm just going to settle for an easy, low-paying job right now and maybe in the future I'll pick studying back up.
	I do appreciate her concern though. Money is important, but so is peace.

    <h2>Moving out</h2>
	Besides the job hunt I also wanted to give you a small update on my 'moving-out-plan'. You see, I recently talked to my aunt 
	whom is planning on moving in with her boyfriend. Since she's renting right now it's basically up in the air who will move into her old place once she's gone. 
	Since I'm looking for a place to live myself, I might actually have a shot at moving into her old place! Pretty exciting if you'd ask me! I was actually planning on applying for an appartment but  my aunt's old place is an entire house!
	I'll keep you up to date if this actually works out (or not).
