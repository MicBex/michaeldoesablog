	<h2>Perfect Blue</h2>
	<p>
    <span title="15th of October 2025" style="text-decoration: underline;">Today</span> I watched an anime movie called <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/437/Perfect-Blue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perfect Blue</a> and let me tell you: it was <strong>confusing!</strong>
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    The movie follows a young woman who ditches her career as an aspiring idol in a pop group for an acting career. She soon discovers that in order to climb the career ladder as an actress she has to let go of many of her principles and her youthful innocence, which causes her mental sanity to slowly spiral out of control.
    <br><br>
    When people around her start being killed one by one her life spirals out of control and she loses grip of reality. Past, present and future all seem to blend into one distored timeline which she can't seem to escape no matter what. Is she the one killing all of the people around her? It sure seems like it.

    <h2>ChatGPT</h2>
    <p>
    I'm not planning on spoiling the movie for you as I genuinely believe you should watch it yourself. But let me just tell you that after an hour of watching the movie takes a psychological dark turn, distorting the reality of both the protagonist as well as yours, the viewer.
    <br><br>
    I'm not too prideful to admit that I needed to ask <a href="https://chatgpt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChatGPT</a> to explain the ending of the movie to me. Fortunately, once properly explained, it did all click and I can now say that I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I watched the entire movie via <a href="https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ani-Cli</a> on my Google Pixel 8 using <a href="https://termux.dev/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Termux</a> by the way, such a cool tool for your terminal! I am using Ani-Cli (and <a href="https://github.com/DemonKingSwarn/flix-cli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flix-Cli</a>) a ton after discovering both a couple of days ago.
