	<h2>It's not you, it's me</h2>
	<p>
    I'm kind of done with gaming. Not in the dramatic "I'll never play games again" kind of way, but I am noticing a shift in my interests, one of those shifts being a lack of interest in video games. At first I thought it was modern gaming's fault, but then I stopped being a prententious dick and figured out that it wasn't gaming's fault: it was me. I am outgrowing a hobby I've loved ever since I was a kid.

    Sure, gaming in 2025 is very different from gaming in the early 2000's, but that doesn't mean that gaming has gotten worse. Gaming has never been better and I'm sure it'll continue to get better. Are there things that have gotten worse? Yep: micro-transactions, rediculous DLC prices and padded playtime being some of these things. But still, gaming in 2025 is crazy good, whether that is on console or PC.

    <h2>Buying didn't solve my problems</h2>
    <p>
    These past couple of years I've bought plenty of games, but recently I realized that I haven't been playing any of them. I liked buying games on Steam and physical PlayStation 5 releases, but actually playing them? Not really. In 2025 I finished a whopping 5 games: Stellar Blade (which was mainly played in 2024), Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, Grand Theft Auto 3 Definitive Edition, Wild Guns and Katana Zero.
    <br><br>
    Because I barely play and finish games anymore I have therefore decided to stop buying games. This feels very freeing. For some reason I have been feeling pressured into buying and playing games, even though I don't feel like doing so.

    <h2>New Hobbies</h2>
    I am currently trying to figure out how to spend my free time without gaming. For now, watching YouTube videos is my main source of fun. But I really feel like I should also watch more anime and pick up reading manga again. I am also trying to get into reading non-fiction books again, which I used to love. The first book I'll be reading again is Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport.
    <br><br>
    Besides my usual hobbies, I am also trying to just embrace boredom. I am hoping that by being bored from time to time I will naturally figure out what step to take next. Self-improvement is something I'm trying to get into as well: I'm currently in the process of losing weight and have already lost 5KG. I still have a long way to go though.
