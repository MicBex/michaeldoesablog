	<h2>PolyMarket</h2>
	<p>
	I like gambling. I barely every do it, but when I do, I love it. I used to play a lot of blackjack and was actually pretty darn good at it. Nontheless, knowing fully well that gambling is not a sustainable way of making money I decided to quit playing blackjack a long time ago.
	<br><br>
	A week ago I discovered a new form of gambling though: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymarket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PolyMarket</a>. PolyMarket, through the magic of crypto currency, allows one to gamble on anything and everything. From anything Trump-related, who will win the Nobel Prize to full-blown geopolitics, you can basically bet on any outcome.
	<br><br>
	Now PolyMarket combines two things I love: crypto & gambling. So when I found out about this website I just had to give it a shot. Keep in mind that, at this point, I hadn’t gambled in years.

	<h2>My bets</h2>
	<p>
	I set up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinbase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coinbase</a> account in order to buy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USDC_(cryptocurrency)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">USDC</a>, set up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetaMask" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MetaMask</a> account in order to receive the USDC and then via my MetaMask account send the USDC to my PolyMarket account. I decided to take 100 bucks and invest it in several geo-political bets:
    <br><br>
    <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/israel-x-hamas-ceasefire-by-october-31/israel-x-hamas-ceasefire-by-october-31" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Will Hamas and Israel have a ceasefire before October 31st 2025?</a> <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/will-trump-announce-a-national-housing-emergency-in-2025/will-trump-announce-a-national-housing-emergency-in-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Will Trump announce a national housing emergency before 2026?</a> <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/us-x-venezuela-military-engagement-by-october-31/us-x-venezuela-military-engagement-by-december-31-391" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Will there be a military engagement between the USA and Venezuala before 2026?</a>
    <br><br>
    I made more bets then these and if you’re interested in finding out what bets I made and if they were profitable, I’ll leave <a href="https://polymarket.com/@lilslut" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my profile here</a>.

	<h2>So how did you lose?!</h2>
	<p>
	Now the title of this post says: I bet on Politics & LOST Everything, yet the publication date of this post is way before any of these bets were sealed. So why the title? Is it clickbait?
    <br><br>
    Nope, not clickbait at all! I actually lost everything, no matter if I win the bets or not. Why?
    <br><br>
    Well, you see, I made a whoopsie that caused me to lose no matter what. MetaMask is a crypto wallet that can be used as an extension in your browser. For some reason, I didn’t save the seed phrase of my wallet and I forgot the password to my wallet too… so uhh… yeah… I can’t open my wallet anymore.
    <br><br>
    And yes, my PolyMarket acccount is linked to my MetaMask wallet, not to an email account. You see, if it were linked to an email account I could just send my winnings to a different wallet. But uhh… yeah… I didn’t do that.
