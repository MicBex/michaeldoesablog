    <h2>It's not?!</h2>
    <p>I watch a lot of YouTube during the evenings. For me it's a way to unwind after a long day.
    Recently I'm starting to notice a trend where young
people blame their smartphones as the <strong>main</strong>
cause for being unproductive. In fact, many have started
replacing their smartphones with dumbphones! It's the
hip thing to do. Well I'm here to tell you that it's
<strong>not</strong> your phone that is holding you back.
Because you're not addicted to your phone but to social media.</p>

<h2>It's a tool</h2>
<p>Being addicted to social media blows. Although I don't know
what it's like to be addicted to something like Instagram 
I can understand that having to do something compulsively 
is never a good thing. Blaming your smartphone for 
these addictions is the wrong move though if you'd ask me. 
A smartphone is just a tool. You choose whether or not to install 
Instagram or Tiktok on there.</p>
<br>

<p>I am currently writing this blog post on my 
Google Pixel 8 via Termux. I'll spare you the details 
on how that works exactly, but what I'm trying to say 
is that my smartphone is not an addiction to me. 
I'm using it as a tool. A <strong>very</strong> useful 
tool.</p>

<h2>Be productive <strong>using</strong> your phone</h2>
<p>There are so many useful ways you can use your phone 
instead of doom scrolling. Learn a new language via Anki, 
create videos for your new YouTube channel on CapCut, 
write a diary entry using Obsidian, track your calories 
on MyFitnessPal to lose weight and so much more.
I think you understand where I'm going with this: there 
is so much you can do with a phone. And what are you 
using it for? Instagram?</p>
<br>
<p>Why aren't we also blaming PC's and laptops for 
making us unproductive then? They can access social 
media, so are they just as evil as smartphones? I barely 
hear anyone talking about that...</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So if it wasn't clear yet, I think smartphones aren't 
the problem. In fact I think smartphones are pretty neat.
The problem is a lack of willpower. Stop using social media 
if it's harmful to you. Stop using websites and apps 
that stop you from being productive. And stop blaming 
smartphones for your addiction.</p>
