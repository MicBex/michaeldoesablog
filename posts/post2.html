		<h3>New Anime is always exciting!</h3>
    <p>Summer 2025 is here which also means another batch of new anime is upon us. In this post I'll be talking about both completely new anime as well as new seasons of already running shows. I won't be going over every new release either, only the ones I'll be giving a try myself. I like to keep it short and simple so here we go!<br>

    <h3>#1 Diving & Alcohol</h3>
    The anime I'm looking forward to the most is a wonderful show all about drinking alcohol & diving: <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/182309/Grand-Blue-Dreaming-Season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grand Blue Dreaming Season 2</a>. I loved the first season so much that when I was on holiday in Japan I decided to buy all of the manga volumes available at the time in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_Off" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Book Off</a> in Tokyo. Don't expect anything deep from this anime, it's just young adults having dumb fun. They drink alcohol and go diving, that's about it. If you've been to college yourself this anime will bring back a lot of memories, it sure did for me!<br>

    <h3>#2 Golden Balls</h3>
    The second anime I'm looking forward to quite a bit is the <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/185660/DAN-DA-DAN-Season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">second season of Dandadan</a>. It's about a guy who believes in aliens and a girl who believes in ghosts. They're make fun of each other at first until they discover that both things exist and turn against them. The story is more complex then I'm sketching it right now but all you have to know is that there's a lot of cool battles, funny dialogue, awesome animation and even a bit of teen romance here and there. The main character loses his balls and now our main characters need to get them back while fighting aliens and ghosts. Not really sure where I had to squeeze that information in so here it is I guess.<br>

    <h3>#3 Garabge</h3>
    The third anime I'll be watching is all about living in and around garbage. The rich float above the poor and dump their garbage beneath them, causing the poor living closer to the ground to sustain themselves on said garbage. There is some magic going on and the fights are great. It's called <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/178025/Gachiakuta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gachiakuta</a> by the way. How do I know even though this is the first season? I read the manga. Yeah, you can just do that. <a href="https://mangafire.to/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here is a link</a> to my favorite manga website. Anyway, this boy who doesn't live with the rich folk but isn't living below them either is framed for something he didn't do and is therefore exiled to the depths where all the garbage is. I'm not sure how much this anime will cover from the manga so that's where I'll keep it at for now.

    <h3>#4 Vampires</h3>
    The fourth anime I'll be watching is actually one I got into recently. You see, a couple of weeks ago I just started playing <a href="https://youtu.be/9YFTgB78bDY?si=z-98alpDJhgOGuxf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Old School RuneScape</a>, the Free To Play version, just to see if I liked it. It turns out that I did, but that's not why I'm telling you this. While playing Old School RuneScape I wanted to watch an anime on my second screen, as OSRS has very repetitious gameplay. And it turns out this anime was <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/141391/Call-of-the-Night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Call of the Night</a>. <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/175914/Call-of-the-Night-Season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Season 2</a> will be coming out this summer and although this anime didn't blow my mind by how good it was, it definitely was a fun watch nontheless. To keep the tradition going I'll be watching Call of the Night season 2 on my second monitor while playing OSRS.<br>
    The anime is about a guy who loves going out during the night. He's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEET" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEET</a> and during the night he feels like everything will be okay. He is at peace. Then, one night, he meets this girl who turns out to be a vampire. She sucks his blood and tells him this story about how if you fall in love with a vampire you can become one yourself. And guess what: our protagonist now sets out to become a vampire himself. Again, nothing mindblowing but it's a fun watch.<br>

    <h3>#5 Mineral Collecting</h3>
    Alright, for my fifth and final anime I'm picking an entry that I know absolutely nothing about. It's an anime called <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/180929/Ruri-Rocks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruri Rocks</a> and it's all about mineral collecting. It's a cutesy slice of life anime with a primarely cute female cast and although I'm certain this one is not for everyone I do tend to like these ones a lot. For example I'm a big fan of <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/5680/KON/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">K-ON</a>, <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/176246/mono/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mono</a>, <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/98444/LaidBack-Camp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Laid-Back Camp</a>, <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/21776/Miss-Kobayashis-Dragon-Maid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid</a>, <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/99426/A-Place-Further-Than-the-Universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Place Further Than The Universe</a> and much more. I know absolutely nothing about this show but it did catch my eye, so I decided to include it in this list.<br>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    So these are the new anime I'll be watching during the summer. I'll definitely be watching more than this, but most of the other shows I'm going to watch are old and so it didn't make sense to list them here. If you're curious about watching anime for free then I'd highly advice <a href="https://hianime.to/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this website</a>.<br><br>
