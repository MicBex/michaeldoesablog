	<h2>My Japan Trip</h2>
	<p>
    I've been back from my Japan trip for about <span title="12th of November 2025" style="text-decoration: underline;">2 days</span> now and don’t get me wrong, I had a good time. I met wonderful people and even got invited to go on a helicopter ride by a complete stranger, but nontheless, I can now say with confidence that I’m done with Japan.
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    As promised I visited all the places I wanted to see one more time and so I visited Fushimi Inari Taisha, Dotonbori and the deer in Nara of course.
    <br><br>
    I stayed in Japan for two weeks and although I thoroughly enjoyed my first week, I noticed that during my second week I really felt done with the whole thing.
	</p>

    <h2>Japan changed</h2>
    <p>
    You see, Japan changed an awful lot in the 8 years I have been away. Three things really stood out:
    <ol>
    	<li>There are an insane amount of tourists now in Japan</li>
    	<li>There are quite a bit of immigrants from India, Indonesia & China in Japan now</li>
    	<li>The Japanese have a very different, more hostile attitude towards foreigners now.</li>
    </ol>
    <br><br>
    Every store and restaurant I visited had foreigners working there, I heard more Chinese in the streets of Osaka then Japanese, and because I speak Japanese I had the opportunity to hear people complain about foreigners on the train, waiting in line and just walking down the streets of Osaka, Kyoto and Nara.
    <br><br>
    If I compare my time in Japan during my university days in Osaka 8 years ago and now I can realy tell the difference. Japan is not the same anymore. To be fair, I’m not the same anymore either.
    </p>
