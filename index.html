	<p><b>Welcome to my blog!</b> As you might've already expected; my name is Michael. I love old sitcoms from the 80's, 90's & 00's, (retro) anime, (retro) games, Japan and watching YouTube videos.<br><br>

	<h2>Who are you?</h2>
	<p>I used to be a high school history teacher. I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgfVEmQxM84" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quit this job</a> though as I couldn't stand it anymore. I loved teaching and spending time with my students, but everything else about that job was awful.<br>
	I'm currently in the process of figuring out what I want to do with my life. It turns out that's harder then I expected.<br><br>
	I used to run a YouTube channel called 'Razovy'. In less than a month I got this channel monetized and was making good money with it. On this channel I mainly talked about <a href="https://theindex.moe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anime piracy</a> which, at the time, was incredibly uncommon on YouTube. In fact, I dare to argue that I was the only person talking about anime streaming websites and the likes.<br>
	After a couple of years of running this channel YouTube changed its Community Guidelines and decided that anime piracy was a no-go, and so my channel received strike after strike until it was eventually terminated.<br><br>
	This completely ruined my plans for the future as I was planning on becoming a digital nomad while working on my YouTube channel. I now had to figure out a different path and... well... failed miserably. For 6 miserable years I worked my teaching job and hated every second of it, eventually leading to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MATlQKe4V2k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">burn out</a>.<br><br>

	I'm now at a point where I'm starting to realize that I need to do something that I actualy want to do, even if it pays less. You see, the only reason I stayed at my teaching job is because it paid so well here in Holland.
	<h2>Why does your website look so basic?</h2>
	I like it that way. Nowadays everything needs to look so fancy and slick because otherwise "it's not legit". Who cares about any of that?! I used to love the old website designs from the 90's & 00's and with this website I'm bringing it back!</p><br><br>
